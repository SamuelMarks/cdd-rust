## Discussion

Syntax parsing in rust has several options. Here are some findings.

- syn https://github.com/dtolnay/syn - generally written for procedural macro generation, but supports heavy tokenisation. does not seem to support writing back to rust code.
- rustc-ap-syntax https://crates.io/crates/rustc-ap-syntax - autogenerated crate from the rustc repo. used by rustfmt. very little documentation.
