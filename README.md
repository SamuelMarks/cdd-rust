# cdd-rust

Compiler driven development implementation for Rust (actix, diesel)

## Running

```
cargo run -- examples/simple_struct.rs
```

## Discussion

Syntax parsing in rust has several options. Here are some findings.

- syn https://github.com/dtolnay/syn - generally written for procedural macro generation, but supports heavy tokenisation. does not seem to support writing back to rust code.
- rustc-ap-syntax https://crates.io/crates/rustc-ap-syntax - autogenerated crate from the rustc repo. used by rustfmt. very little documentation.

Compiler driven development implementation for Rust (actix, diesel).

## Developer guide

Install the latest version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). We tend to use nightly versions. [CLI tool for installing Rust](https://rustup.rs).

We use [rust-clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy) linters to improve code quality.

There are plenty of [IDEs](https://areweideyet.com) and other [Rust development tools to consider](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust#development-tools).

### Step-by-step guide

```bash
# Install Rust (nightly)
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain nightly
# Install cargo-make (cross-platform feature-rich reimplementation of Make)
$ cargo install --force cargo-make
# Install rustfmt (Rust formatter)
$ rustup component add rustfmt
# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/offscale/cdd-rust && cd cdd-rust/openapi_generator
# Run tests
$ cargo test
# Format, build and test
$ cargo make
```
